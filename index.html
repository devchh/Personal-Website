      <p> I've created this mostly to maintain an easy way to portray my portfolio things that I have an interest in. </p>
      <p> I have learned very recently that time management, albeit very rarely talked about, is extremely important to lead a significant life. </p>
      <p> I have as a result, begun taking part in various activities such as Kickboxing, Rowing and even going for Runs!</p>
      <br>
      <p> Apart from this my daily interests include <a href = "books.html">reading,</a><a href = "photography.html">taking photographs,</a> going on long walks and spending time with my friends who always teach me new things! </p>
